# Development Learnings and Research Findings

## Technology Stack Research

### Expo & React Native
- Using Expo SDK latest version with TypeScript template for optimal type safety
- React Native 0.76.3 is compatible with current Expo version

### UI Framework Integration
- Selected `twrnc` for Tailwind CSS integration due to its:
  - Native support for React Native
  - Runtime performance optimizations
  - Full compatibility with Tailwind CSS syntax

### Form Handling
- Implementing `react-hook-form` with Zod for:
  - Type-safe form validation
  - Runtime type checking
  - Improved developer experience

## Development Decisions

### Project Structure
- Organized components by feature/domain for better scalability
- Implemented strict TypeScript configuration
- Set up modular folder structure for better code organization

### Next Steps
- Research shadcn UI integration with React Native
- Investigate best practices for component documentation
- Plan component library structure

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Integrating Tailwind with React Native
  Solution: Using twrnc for native support
- Challenge: Type-safe form handling
  Solution: Combining react-hook-form with Zod for full type safety
